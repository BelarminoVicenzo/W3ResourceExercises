# W3ResourceExercises
To spend time solving W3resource's exercises I going to start with https://www.w3resource.com/csharp-exercises/basic/index.php I know those are easy for my actual skill, but I think it will be fun
 
  
If someone see this repo, and find some mistakes or possible better code tips, feel free to say. All help to make me a bette pro is welcome.

Ps: I've been using VS17, so if one day, someone, somehow, in any manner, for a very unknown reason, decides to fork or download the project. Be warned that you might need C# 7, that is on VS17 or above versions deppending on the century you read this.
